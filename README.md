# BlehWeb
a bunch of files somewhat working together to generate websites

(code is mostly unreadable except for me)

BlehWeb provides tools to generate a website without removing raw code like a CMS would or altering said code's structure like a framework. It "frames" the website into several seperate chunks of procedural php, html and such, aiming to give an organized architecture and yet quite simple as it is not OOP/MVC.

BlehWeb works with grids, modules and themes and thins the boundaries between them all.
